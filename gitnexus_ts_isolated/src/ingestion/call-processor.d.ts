 *
 *   - `processRoutesFromExtracted` — CALLS edges from framework routes
 *     (e.g. Laravel) to their controller methods.
 *   - `processNextjsFetchRoutes` / `extractConsumerAccessedKeys` — FETCHES edges
 *     from `fetch()` calls to Next.js Route nodes.
 *   - `buildExportedTypeMapFromGraph` — exported symbol → return/declared type
 *     map, consumed by the cross-file enrichment pass.

/**
 * Create CALLS edges from extracted framework routes (e.g. Laravel) to their
 * controller methods. Runs for all languages — independent of call resolution.
 *
 * Resolution is registry-based (RING4-2 #943 retired the tiered resolver):
 *   - Controller: **qualified-first** (see {@link resolveControllerByQualifiedName}).
 *     When the routes file disambiguated the controller, the Laravel extractor
 *     threads `route.controllerQualifiedName` (a `use` import — incl. aliased
 *     `use … as X;` — or an inline qualified `::class`, normalized to the dot-
 *     joined key shape). The emitter resolves it by direct qualified lookup, or
 *     by PSR-4 file-path disambiguation when PHP's statement-form namespace left
 *     the registry keyed only by the short name — either way picking the
 *     specific class even when the short name is globally duplicated (the common
 *     admin/public `OrderController` split) or aliased. It falls back to the
 *     global short-name lookup (`lookupClassByName`), which still skips on
 *     ambiguity (`length !== 1`) — so a bare, genuinely ambiguous short name
 *     with no `use`/FQN correctly produces no (wrong) edge.
 *   - Method: resolved within the controller's own file via the symbol table
 *     (the legacy emitter only accepted same-file method resolutions).
 *
 * Edge confidence is a flat {@link ROUTE_EDGE_CONFIDENCE}. Route CALLS edges
 * are gated downstream by the process-trace (`MIN_TRACE_CONFIDENCE`) and
 * large-graph community (`MIN_CONFIDENCE_LARGE`) thresholds (both 0.5); a
 * resolved edge lands at exactly 0.5 and passes (`>= 0.5`). The guessed-method
 * fallback edge (`× 0.8` = 0.4) sits below the gate and is excluded from those
 * passes — acceptable for an edge whose target method could not be resolved.

/**
 * Resolve each route's handler to a real symbol UID, keyed by the route's
 * `(method, url)` identity (`routeNodeKey` — the same key the routes phase uses
 * for the `Route` node). This is the Part 2 (#2138) groundwork that lets
 * `HttpRouteExtractor.extractProvidersGraph` read the handler symbol from the
 * graph instead of re-parsing source via `getDetections()`.
 *
 * Two route shapes, one resolution target — `(filePath, name) → nodeId`:
 *   - Laravel framework routes (`ExtractedRoute`) carry `controllerName` +
 *     `methodName`; resolve the controller (qualified-first) then the method in
 *     the controller's own file (mirrors `processRoutesFromExtracted`).
 *   - Decorator routes (`ExtractedDecoratorRoute`, e.g. Spring/FastAPI) carry
 *     `handlerName` (the decorated method, captured at extraction); resolve it
 *     directly in the route's own file.
 *
 * First-writer-wins per route identity, matching the routes phase's dedup (it
 * keeps the first route registered for a `(method, url)` key and counts the rest
 * as duplicates). The first route to claim a key reserves it **even when its
 * handler is unresolvable**, so a later same-key route can never stamp its
 * handler onto the first route's Route node (the routes phase made that first
 * route the node-winner). Keying is `routeNodeKey(method, url)` (#2289): a
 * same-URL multi-verb pair (`GET /x` + `POST /x`) resolves two handlers, one per
 * node; method-less / wildcard routes key by URL alone, byte-identical to the
 * pre-#2289 behavior. Routes whose handler cannot be *uniquely* resolved (no
 * name, zero matches, or an ambiguous same-name match) carry no
 * `handlerSymbolId`; the extractor then falls back to source scan for that route
 * (fail-open, no regression, never a wrong handler).
